    <p>Authentic French croissants. Patience and effort are required but the results are totally worth it!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons of warm water</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2/3 cup unsalted butter, chilled</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Measure flour into a mixing bowl. Combine warm milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in a separate bowl; blend milk mixture, yeast mixture, and oil into flour. Mix well and knead until smooth. Cover, and let rise until over tripled in volume, about 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Deflate gently, and let rise again until doubled, about another 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Deflate dough and chill for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily. Pat dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle.</li>
    </ol>
